As Software Engineer working with databases, you should be comfortable reading SQL errors to properly fix them, so it's an essential skill for you as a developer.

## Table of Contents

1. Starting with error handling
2. Raising, throwing and customizing your errors

## Error Handling

let's begin with an example to demonstrate the concept of errors on SQL server
Imagine you have a database consisting of Products, Buyers, Staff, and Orders
and you have a unique constraint on the product table (on product_name)
And you tried to insert a product with a name that already exits

```sql
INSERT INTO products (product_name, stock, price)
VALUES ('Trek Powerfly 5 - 2018', 10, 3499.99);
```

what do you think you will get? <br>
Of course an error

```
Violation of UNIQUE KEY constraint 'unique_product_name'.
Cannot insert duplicate key in object 'dbo.products'.
The duplicate key value is (Trek Powerfly 5 - 2018).
```

we can handle this kind of Error using `Try catch` Block. <br>
The syntax of try-catch on SQL is nearly similar to the ones on programming languages,
you begin with try and end with catch, you see it's that simple ðŸ˜„. <br>

The General syntax

```sql
BEGIN TRY
{ sql_statement | statement_block }
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
[ { sql_statement | statement_block } ]
END CATCH
[ ; ]
```

In case of your query inside Try throw an error, then you place your error handling statements with the catch block. <br>
If there is no error, the catch block is skipped

**An example of a statement that fails**

```sql
BEGIN TRY
    INSERT INTO products (product_name, stock, price)
    VALUES ('Trek Powerfly 5 - 2018', 10, 3499.99);
    SELECT 'Product inserted correctly!' AS message;
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
    SELECT 'An error occurred! You are in the CATCH block' AS message;
END CATCH
```

```
| message
|
|-----------------------------------------------|
| An error occurred! You are in the CATCH block |
```

**An example of successful Insertion**

l

```sql

BEGIN TRY
    INSERT INTO products (product_name, stock, price)
    VALUES ('Super new Trek Powerfly', 5, 1499.99);
    SELECT 'Product inserted correctly!' AS message;
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
    SELECT 'An error occurred! You are in the CATCH block' AS message;
END CATCH
```

```
| message
|
|-----------------------------|
| Product inserted correctly! |
```

### Nested try..catch

A try block or a catch block can `nest` another try-catch block. <br>
**an example of nested try-catch**

Get your hands dirty

nesting

```sql
BEGIN try
    INSERT INTO products (product_name, stock, price)
    VALUES ('Trek Powerfly 5 - 2018', 10, 3499.99);
    SELECT 'Product inserted correctly!' AS message
END TRY

BEGIN catch
    SELECT 'An error occurred inserting the product!
            You are in the first CATCH block' AS message;
    BEGIN TRY
        INSERT INTO myErrors
        VALUES ('ERROR!');
        SELECT 'Error inserted correctly!' AS message;
    END TRY
    BEGIN CATCH
        SELECT 'An error occurred inserting the error!
        You are in the second CATCH block' AS message;
    END CATCH
END CATCH
```

```sql

-- Set up the TRY block
BEGIN TRY
    -- Add the constraint
    ALTER TABLE products
        ADD CONSTRAINT CHK_Stock CHECK (stock >= 0);
END TRY ___
-- Setcatc up the CATCH block
BEGIN CATCH
    SELECT 'An error occurred!';
END CATCH

-- Set up the first TRY block
BEGIN TRY
    INSERT INTO buyers (first_name, last_name, email, phone)
        VALUES ('Peter', 'Thompson', 'peterthomson@mail.com', '555000100');
END TRY
-- Set up the first CATCH block
BEGIN CATCH
    SELECT 'An error occurred inserting the buyer! You are in the first CATCH block';
    -- Set up the nested TRY block
    BEGIN TRY
        INSERT INTO errors
            VALUES ('Error inserting a buyer');
        SELECT 'Error inserted correctly!';
    END  TRY
    -- Set up the nested CATCH block
    BEGIN CATCH
        SELECT 'An error occurred inserting the error! You are in the nested CATCH block';
    END CATCH
END CATCH

```

### Error Anatomy and uncatchable error

> Not all errors are catchable

```sql
INSERT INTO products (product_name, stock, price)
VALUES ('Trek Powerfly 5 - 2018', 10, 3499.99);
```

```
Msg 2627, Level 14, State 1, Line 1
Violation of UNIQUE KEY constraint 'unique_name'.
Cannot insert duplicate key in object 'dbo.products'.
The duplicate key value is (Trek Powerfly 5 - 2018).
```

Let's break down the error message, to compose a useful information and know exactly how to handle error based on it's Anatomy <br>

* The first line is error number
sql errors  from 1 to 49999

you can also create your own starting from `50001`

`select * from sys.message` -> to know the complete log of error numbers
the second value is severity level

* from `0 - 10`: informational messages (warnings)
* from `11 - 16`: errors that can be corrected by the user (constraint violation, etc.)
* from `17 - 26`: other errors (software problems, fatal errors)
you can see the whole list throught the docuemntation

* the thrid value is the state: it give you more informatioj about the error
1: if sql server display error
0-255: own errors -> to raise your own error

Line
give you the line number
finally if the error happended within a stored procedure or a trigger, you will receive extra data giving you the name of the stored procedure or the name of th trigger

the try cath we've learnt can't catch every kind of errors, for example errors witha a severity level lower than 11 (considered as warnining)

11 -> 19 (catchable)

severity of 20 or higher that stopped the connection will not be caught but if it didn't cut the connection, it will be caught

compilation error: object and column that doesn't exit

**An example**

```sql
BEGIN TRY
    select non-existent_column from products;
END TRy
BEGIN CATCH
    select 'you are in the CATCH Block' as message;
end catch
```

notice the outout?

```
Msg 207, Level 16, State 1, Line 2
Invalid column name 'non_existent_column'.
```

### Giving information about error

```
Msg 2627, Level 14, State 1, Line 1
Violation of UNIQUE KEY constraint 'unique_name'.
Cannot insert duplicate key in object 'dbo.products'.
The duplicate key value is (Trek Powerfly 5 - 2018).
this is the original error
```

and this is the error returned from catch block

```sql
BEGIN TRY
    INSERT INTO products (product_name, stock, price)
    VALUES ('Trek Powerfly 5 - 2018', 10, 3499.99);
    SELECT 'Product inserted correctly!' AS message;
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
    SELECT 'An error occurred! You are in the CATCH block' AS message;
END CATCH
```

```sql

| message
|
|-----------------------------------------------|
| An error occurred! You are in the CATCH block |
```

sometimes the default error the query throws is very useful, and by overriding it using CATCH with error statement we lose the default, however can still retrieve it using
**Error functions**

`ERROR_NUMBER()` returns the number of the error.
`ERROR_SEVERITY()` returns te error severity (11-19)
`ERROR_STATE()`  returns the state of the error
`ERROR_LINE()` retuens the numberl of the line error
`ERROR_PROCEDURE()` returns the name of the sotred proc/trigger, Null if there i not stored pro/trig
`Error_message()`
an example

```sql
BEGIN TRY
INSERT INTO products (product_name, stock, price)
VALUES ('Trek Powerfly 5 - 2018', 10, 3499.99);
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
SELECT
ERROR_NUMBER() AS Error_number,
ERROR_SEVERITY() AS Error_severity,
ERROR_STATE() AS Error_state,
ERROR_PROCEDURE() AS Error_procedure,
ERROR_LINE() AS Error_line,
ERROR_MESSAGE() AS Error_message;
END CATCH
```

| Error_number| Error_severity| Error_state| Error_procedure| Error_line| Error_message|
|-------------|---------------|------------|----------------|-----------|--------------|
| 2627 | 14 | 1 | NULL | 2 | Violation of UNIQUE KEY constraint 'unique_name'... |

â›”**Warning**: <br>
> We can't use error functions outside the catch block

```sql
SELECT
ERROR_NUMBER() AS Error_number,
ERROR_SEVERITY() AS Error_severity,
ERROR_STATE() AS Error_state,
ERROR_PROCEDURE() AS Error_procedure,
ERROR_LINE() AS Error_line,
ERROR_MESSAGE() AS Error_message;
```

you will get nulls

we can use it inside nested try and catch

```sql
BEGIN TRY
    INSERT INTO products (product_name, stock, price)
    VALUES ('Trek Powerfly 5 - 2018', 10, 3499.99);
END TRY
    BEGIN CATCH
    BEGIN TRY
INSERT INTO myErrors
    VALUES ('ERROR!')
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
    SELECT
    'Outer CATCH block' AS 'Error_from',
    ERROR_NUMBER() AS Error_number,
    ERROR_MESSAGE() AS Error_message;
    END CATCH
END CATCH
```

### exercise

```sql
-- Set up the TRY block
BEGIN TRY
    SELECT 'Total: ' + SUM(price * quantity) AS total
    FROM orders  
END TRY
-- Set up the CATCH block
BEGIN CATCH  
    -- Show error information.
    SELECT  ERROR_NUMBER() AS number,  
            ERROR_SEVERITY() AS severity_level,  
            ERROR_STATE() AS state,
            ERROR_LINE() AS line,  
            ERROR_MESSAGE() AS message;
END CATCH
```

```sql
BEGIN TRY
    INSERT INTO products (product_name, stock, price) 
    VALUES  ('Trek Powerfly 5 - 2018', 2, 3499.99),         
            ('New Power K- 2018', 3, 1999.99)       
END TRY
-- Set up the outer CATCH block
BEGIN CATCH
    SELECT 'An error occurred inserting the product!';
    -- Set up the inner TRY block
    BEGIN TRY
        -- Insert the error
        INSERT INTO errors 
            VALUES ('Error inserting a product');
    END Try    
    -- Set up the inner CATCH block
    BEGIN CATCH
        -- Show number and message error
        SELECT 
            ERROR_LINE() AS line,      
            ERROR_MESSAGE() AS message; 
    END CATCH    
END CATCH

```

## Raising, throwing, and customizing your errors

In this section we will learn

* how to raise errors.
* re-throw original errors.
* create your own defined errors.

Raise errors statements
sql server provides two statement to raise errors
RAISEERROR
`THROW` (microsoft recommend using it on new application)

```sql
RAISEERROR ssyntax
```

the first parameter can be a message string, a message id, or a varibale that contains the message string.
the second prarmer -> serverity
the thried -> state

you can optionally add arguments, like strings or numbers

if the message string has some parameter placeholders such as %s or %d, these arguments will replace them

### RAISERROR with message string

```sql
if not exits( select * from staff where staff_id = 15)
    RAISERROR('No staff member with such id', 16, 1);
```

If we don't specicy an error number, the error number will always be `50000`

let's change the message text with placeholders

```sql
RAISERROR('No %s member with such id %d. ', 16, 1, 'staff member', 15);
```

### RAISERROR with error number

```sql
RAISERROR(60000, 16, 1);
```

this erorr number comes from `sys.messages`

**RIASERROR - Example with Try .. Catch**

```sql
from the first slide
```

if we changed the severity level from 9 to 11, the error will caught by catch

#### Exercise

```sql
BEGIN TRY
    -- Change the value
    DECLARE @product_id INT = 5;
    IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT *FROM products WHERE product_id = @product_id)
        RAISERROR('No product with id %d.', 11, 1, @product_id);
    ELSE
SELECT* FROM products WHERE product_id = @product_id;
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
    SELECT ERROR_MESSAGE();
END CATCH
```

### Throw statment

> Recommended by Microsoft over RAISERROR statemnt

Genral syntax

```sql

```

unlike the RAISERROR statement, the THROW statement allows re-throwing an original error caught by a CATCH block
an example

```sql

```

output

```


```

Notice that the error message is the original error message not the one we have specified in select statement in catch block
be careful when writing THROW at the end, you should put semi-colon before the line

```sql

```

SQL Server thinks that the word THROW is an alias for the select statement

THROW - with parameters

```sql

```

this syntax can be included within a CATCH block or outside of it.

```sql
THROW 52000, 'This is an example', 1;
```

throw statement doesn't allow the inclusion of parameters placeholders such as %d or %s but we have a hack around this

notice that the throw statement doens't allow the specification of the serverity, sql server always sets it to 16

THROW - with parameters

```sql


```

some exercises
1-You want to prepare a stored procedure to insert new products in the database. In that stored procedure, you want to insert the possible errors in a table called errors, and after that, re-throw the original error.

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE insert_product
  @product_name VARCHAR(50),
  @stock INT,
  @price DECIMAL

AS

BEGIN TRY
 INSERT INTO products (product_name, stock, price)
  VALUES (@product_name, @stock, @price);
END TRY
-- Set up the CATCH block
begin catch
 -- Insert the error and end the statement with a semicolon
    insert into errors VALUES ('Error inserting a product');
    -- Re-throw the error
 throw; 
end catch
```

2- Executing a stored procedure that throws an error

```sql
BEGIN TRY
 -- Execute the stored procedure
 EXEC insert_product
     -- Set the values for the parameters
     @product_name = 'Trek Conduit+',
        @stock = 3,
        @price = 499.99;
END TRY
-- Set up the CATCH block
Begin catch 
 -- Select the error message
 SELECT error_message();
end catch
```
