go fix #  finds Go programs that use old APIs and rewrites them to use newer ones.
go generate #  is usually used for code generation.
go install #  compiles and installs packages and dependencies.
go clean # is used for cleaning files that are generated by compilers.

```

## Build

```sh
go build -o app
./app
```

`GOOS` and `GOARCH`
help us build go program fir different operating systems and underlying processor architecture

```sh
go tool
go tool dist list # list supported architectures
```

Here's an example of building a windows's executable from macOS

```sh
GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o app.exe
```

`CGO_ENABLED` enables us to configure a CGO, which is a way in Go to call C code.

This helps us to produce a statically linked binary that works without any external dependencies.

This is quite helpful for, let's say when we want to run our go binaries in a docker container with minimum external dependencies.

Here's an example of how to use it:

```sh
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o app
```
