# Introduction

Writing SQL queries is a skill, you don't want to just "do" SQL queries, but to do them "Right" and in an efficient manner.
Optimization is a big and complex topic and sometimes misunderstood. It requires discipline and experience to begin this topic.

I hope this series will be useful to anyone who wants to dig further into the topic, not just depending on my articles, and I will be happy if anyone gives me feedback either negative or positive.

In each article I will list some of the resources that will help you dig further, most of the resources are books.

1. Filtering and Ordering
2. Query performance tuning

## Table of Contents

The series is divided into many parts

1. Introduction and Ordering
2. Filtering and Data Interrogation
3. Sub-queries and presence or absence
4. Query performance tuning (Indexes, Execution Plans)

## Resources

I depend mainly on the following content:

- <a href="https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/improving-query-performance-in-sql-server">Improving Query Performance in SQL Server</a> From Datacamp.
- High-Performance SQL
- Series of Articles written by Bent Ozar
