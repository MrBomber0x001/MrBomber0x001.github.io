## Table of contents

1. Intro go CSP Concurrency model in Go (routines, channels, mutex, callback)
2. CSP concurrency patterns
3. Mutex
4. Deadlocks
5. Concurrency Patterns

Go is a multi-paradigm programming language
Go's Concurrency allows us to:

- Construct `Streaming data pipelines`
- Make efficient use of I/O and multiple CPUs
- Allows complex systems with multiple components
- `Routines` can start, run and complete simultaneously
- Raises the efficiency of the applications

## Concurrency

- Concept of Concurrency
- Differentiating between Concurrency and Parallelism
- CSP versus actor based Concurrency

## Progress

- [ ] concurrency
- [ ] Goroutines
- [ ] callbacks
- [ ] Mutexes
- [ ] Channels
- [ ] Using it all  - Concurrent Singleton
