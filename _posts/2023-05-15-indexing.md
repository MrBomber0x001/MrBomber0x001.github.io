## Intro

Indexes (also called “keys” in MySQL) are data structures that storage engines use to find rows quickly. They also have several other beneficial properties that we’ll explorein this chapter.

Thus, they are not standardized: indexing works slightly differently in each engine, and not all engines support all types of indexes. Even when multiple engines support the same index type, they might implement it differently under the hood

In MySQL, a storage engine uses indexes in as in book's index you used to search for pages containing specific terms. It searches the index’s data structure for a value. When it finds a match, it can find the row that contains the match. Suppose you run the following query

```sql
SELECT first_name FROM sakila.actor WHERE actor_id = 5;
```

> [!info]
> An index contains values from one or more columns in a table. If you index more than one column, the column order is very important, because MySQL can only search efficiently on a leftmost prefix of the index

Creating an index on two columns is not the same as creating two separate single-column indexes, as you’ll see.

## Type of indexes

There are many types of indexes, each designed to perform well for different purposes.
We're going to cover

- B-Tree Index
- Hash Index
- Bitmap Index

> [!info]
> Indexes are implemented in the storage engine layer, not the server layer.

MySQL used B-tree index by default on `CREATE TABLE` and other statements. However, storage engines might use different storage structures internally.

Storage engines use B-Tree indexes in various ways, which can affect performance. For instance, MyISAM uses a prefix compression technique that makes indexes smaller, but InnoDB leaves values uncompressed in its indexes. Also, MyISAM indexes refer to the indexed rows by their physical storage locations, but InnoDB refers to them by their primary key values which is the cluster key. [more on that later]. Each variation has benefits and drawbacks.

the general idea of of B-tree is that all the values are stored in order, and each leaf page is the same distance from the root.

This figure shows an abstraction of a B-tree index used by InnoDB storage engine

Leaf pages are special, because they have pointers to the indexed data instead of pointers to other pages. (Different storage engines have different types of “pointers” to the data.)

Because B-tree store the indexes columns in order, they're useful for searchhind for ranges of data.

Let's take an example

```sql
CREATE TABLE People ( 
 last_name varchar(50) not null,
 first_name varchar(50) not null, 
 dob date not null, 
 gender enum('m', 'f')not null, 
 key(last_name, first_name, dob) 
);
```

The index here will contain the values from the lat_name,, first_name, and dob columns for every row in the table
Here's how the index arranges the data it stores
![[Pasted image 20230515182832.png]]

Notice that the index sorts the values according to the order of the columns given in the index in the CREATE TABLE statement

> It's way more important to know when to use B-tree and when not to!

There're some types of queries that can use a B-tree index, which are the ones that can be used for **lookups** by

- full key value
- key range
- key prefix

> [!danger]
> They're useful only if the lookup uses a leftmost prefix of the index.

Taking the previous example in considerations, let's look when the index will be used and when it not would be!

**Match the full value key**
Specifying values for all columns in the index.

```sql
SELECT first_name FROM People WHERE last_name = 'Allen' AND first_name = 'Cuba' AND dob = '1960-01-01'
```

**Match a leftmost prefix**
Find all people with the last name Allen, this will use only the first column in the index

```sql
SELECT first_name FROM People WHERE last_name = 'Allen'
```

**Match a column prefix**
Matching on the first part of a column's value, for example, finding all people whose last names begin with J

```sql
SELECT first_name FROM People WHERE last_name LIKE 'J%'
```

**Match a range of values**
You an find people whose last names are between Allen and Meska

```sql
SELECT first_name FROM People WHERE last_name BETWEEN 'Allen' AND 'Meska';
```

**Match one part exactly and match a range on another part**
This index can help you find everyone whose last name is Allen and whose first name starts with the letter K (Kim, Karl, etc.). This is an exact match on last_ name and a range query on first_name

```sql
SELECT first_name FROM People WHERE last_name = 'Allen' AND first_name LIKE 'K%'
```

**Match index-only queries**
B-Tree indexes can normally support index-only queries, which are queries that access only the index, not the row storage. We discuss this optimization later in “Covering Indexes"

> [!info]
> Another important benefit from using B-tree is finding values in sorted order as well lookups, Because B-tree's nodes are sorted.

So B-tree index would be helpful for `ORDER BY`  and `GROUP BY` clauses

### Drawbacks and limitations of using B-tree index

They're not useful if the lookup does not **<u>start</u>**<u></u> from the leftmost side of the indexed colum

```sql
SELECT first_name FROM People WHERE first_name = 'Yousef';
```

The ubove quey will not use the index.
Also you can't find people whose last name **ends** with a particular letter, for examaple the below query will not use the index.

```sql
SELECT first_name FROM People WHERE last_name LIKE '%J';

```

The storage engine can’t optimize accesses with any columns to the right of the first range condition. For example, if your query is

```sql
WHERE last_name="Smith" AND first_name LIKE 'J%' AND dob='1976-12-23'
```

the index access will use only the first two columns in the index, because the LIKE is a range condition (the server can use the rest of the columns for other purposes, though). For a column that has a limited number of values, you can often work around this by specifying equality conditions instead of range conditions. We show detailed examples of this in the indexing case study later in this chapter

Some of these limitations are not inherent to B-Tree indexes, but are a result of how the MySQL query optimizer and storage engines use indexes. Some of them might be removed in the future

Now you know why we said the column order is extremely important: these limitations are all related to column ordering. For optimal performance, you might need to create indexes with the same columns in different orders to satisfy your queries.

if the information you're searching for in the index itself, it's called "inline query", like
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT id from employees where id = 1; # (Id where is primary key (btree))
It will show you that Heap Fetches are 0
opposing to this query SELECT name from employees where id = 2 (name has no index on it )
So, First thing will happen, the engine will go to the page using the id (on the index) which containthe information we need about name (which is stored on disk [another read]) If we do the query above again, it will result in much smaller time, because caching
Let's look at another query

```sql
SELECT id from employee where name = 'Zsh';
```

this will result in Sequential scan which cost alot of time. [Fulltable scan].
Although mySql does something intelligent somehow by applying worker threads so it can dsequential scan in parallel
If we now make an index on name

```sql
CREATE INDEX employee_idx on employees(name)
```

$ Bitmap index created
Now let's seaerch

```sql
SELECT id,name FROM employees Where name = 'Yousef'; (index will be used)
SELECT id,name FROM employees WHERE name like '%You%' (index will not be used) # 
```

becausactually this expression is not a single value, we've alot of possabilites.

## Clustered Index vs Non-Clustered Index

Clustered Index (only 1 on the table, mostly the primary key)

![[Pasted image 20230515170138.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230515170149.png]]
  
Non-clustered index
suppose we've created a non-clustered index on the name column
![[Pasted image 20230515170904.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230515171042.png]]
Row locators contain:

- Cluster key (employee_id)
- actual row [name]

Both clustered index and non-clustered index are working together to find the data!

What are the steps used to find the actual row ?
![[Pasted image 20230515171236.png]]

1. SQL servers used non-clustered index on the name column to quicly find the employee entry on the index
2. Clustered index (employee_id) is used to find the actual row!

> In sql server we read the execution plan from top to bottom and from right to left!

![[Pasted image 20230515171646.png]]
When a query navigate through the clustered index tree to the base table data, this is called **Clustered index seek**
The clustered index contains the base table data itself, this is why you can create one clustere index

![[Pasted image 20230515172825.png]]

**non-clustered index** is seperate from the base data, the base data could exist instead as clustered index
the data directly available may be limited because usually non-clustered indexes only include a subset of columns from the table

if values from columns not in the index are requested, the query may navigate back to the base data using the references mentioned earlier
If the query optimizer decides that doing that is too expensive, it may fall back on scaning the base data instead of using the index

Non-clustered index begin seperate from the base data brings about a couple of important features

**Filtered indexes** only contains rows that meet a user-defind predicate, and to create these you use `WHERE` clause on the index definition, so clustered index can't be used because it has to contain all the data on the table.

```sql
CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IX_PhoneBook_NCI 
ON dbo.PhoneBook(LastName, FirstName)
WHERE (LastName >= 'Yousef');
```

Summary:
A clusterd index is a way of representing data as a whole
A non-clustered index is a physically seperate structure that refernces the base data and can different sort order

```SQL
/** Clustered index **/
ALTER TABLE dbo.MyTable
 ADD CONSTRAINT PK_MyTable PRIMARY KEY(Id);

/**Nonclustered index**/
ALTER TABLE dbo.MyTable
ADD CONSTRAINT UC_MyTable_Id UNIQUE(Id);
```
